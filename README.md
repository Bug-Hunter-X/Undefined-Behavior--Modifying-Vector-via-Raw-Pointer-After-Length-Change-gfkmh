This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Rust: modifying a vector through a raw pointer after the vector's length or capacity has been altered.  The `bug.rs` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a safe and correct alternative.  This illustrates the importance of understanding memory management and avoiding unsafe operations unless absolutely necessary.
